<p class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to grow tired of him. </p>

<p class="stutfield ">LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.
Do you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are there more than one?</p>

<p class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.</p>

<p class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!</p>

<p class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.</p>

<p class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the American young lady has been in the room all the time.  
I am afraid some of this clever talk may have shocked her a little.</p>

<p class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!</p>

<p class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had better go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER
WORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How quiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose
you have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the library.</p>

<p class="hester">HESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.</p>

<p class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know, dear.</p>

<p class="hester">HESTER.  I didn’t believe any of it.</p>
