<p class="speech"> Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to grow tired of him.</p>

<h5 class="stutfield " id="names">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>
<p class="speech">  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.
Do you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are there more than one?</p>

<h5 class="allonby" id="names">MRS. ALLONBY. </h5> 
<p class="speech"> There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.</p>

<p class="speech" ><spam class="stage " id="p1">[_in a low voice_]</spam>
 <p>I had completely forgotten that the American young lady has been in the room all the time.  
I am afraid some of this clever talk may have shocked her a little.</p>
</p>
<h5 class="allonby" id="names">MRS. ALLONBY. </h5>
<p class="speech"> Ah, that will do her so much good!</p>

<h5 class="hunstanton" id="names">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>
<p class="speech"> Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had better go over and talk to her.</p>
    <spam class="stage " id="p1">  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER WORSLEY.] </spam> 
    <p>Well, dear Miss Worsley. </p>
        <spam class="stage " id="p1">[_Sitting down beside her_.] </spam>
        <p> How quiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose
you have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the library.</p>

<h5 class="hester" id="names">HESTER.</h5>
<p class="speech">  No, I have been listening to the conversation.</p>

<h5 class="hunstanton" id="names">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>
<p class="speech">  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know, dear.</p>

<h5 class="hester" id="names">HESTER.</h5>
<p class="speech"> I didn’t believe any of it.</p>
