<h3> A Woman of No Importance: A Play.</h3>

<p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.</P>

<p>HESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn’t believe that any women could really hold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your guests.  [_An awkward pause_.]</P>
    
<p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America. Quite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.</P>
   
<p>HESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But true American society consists simply of all the good women and good men we have in our country.</P>
    
<p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant too.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers. We don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.</p>
